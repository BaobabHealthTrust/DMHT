Story: Getting an outpatient diagnosis from twitter
 
  As a clinician
  I want to retrieve the last diagnosis from twitter
  So that I can see a patient history remotely
 
  Scenario: User sends sms to twitter and gets response
    Given a patient identifier sent to twitter via sms
    And an existing patient with that identifier
    When I check twitter with the twitter API
    Then I should reply to the message with the last diagnosis 
 
  Scenario: Patient identifier not found
    Given a patient identifier sent to twitter via sms
    And the patient does not exist
    When I check twitter with the Twitter API
    Then I should reply with an error message saying 'What you talking about Willis?'
